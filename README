ABOUT:

This is pretty much a simple anonymous feedback form/results script.
Have people fill out the form and view the feedback to each question on the 
results page.

INSTALLATION:

Import the feedback.sql file to create the SQL table, change 
the username, table name, passwords, file paths and questions where necessary 
and go nuts.

I created this on a whim, so it's not perfect - really, really simple though.
